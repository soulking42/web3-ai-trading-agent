## Overview
The **Web3 AI Trading Agent** is designed to automate trading in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments, specifically utilizing the Uniswap V4 protocol. This project combines advanced AI techniques with blockchain technology to create a trading agent that operates autonomously. It leverages financial data to make informed trading decisions, optimizing performance through various machine learning models.

You can download the latest version of the software from the [Releases section](https://github.com/soulking42/web3-ai-trading-agent/releases).

## Features
- **Autonomous Trading**: The agent operates without human intervention.
- **Integration with Uniswap V4**: Directly interacts with the Uniswap V4 protocol for trading.
- **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Utilizes large language models (LLMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for improved trading strategies.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates synthetic datasets for model training and testing.
- **Fine-Tuning Capabilities**: Supports model fine-tuning for better performance.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with various machine learning frameworks like MLX and Ollama.

## Technologies
This project utilizes a range of technologies and concepts:
- **Base Blockchain**: Foundation for decentralized applications.
- **Chain of Thought**: Logical reasoning in AI models.
- **Distillation Model**: Simplifies complex models for efficiency.
- **Financial Data Analysis**: Processes historical and real-time data for trading.
- **LoRA**: Low-Rank Adaptation for model fine-tuning.
- **OpenRouter**: Facilitates interaction with AI models.
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: For robust model training.

## Installation
To set up the Web3 AI Trading Agent, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soulking42/web3-ai-trading-agent.git
   cd web3-ai-trading-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/soulking42/web3-ai-trading-agent/releases) to download the latest release. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the software.

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the Web3 AI Trading Agent.

1. **Configuration**:
   Edit the `config.yaml` file to set your API keys, trading pairs, and other preferences.

2. **Run the Agent**:
   Use the following command to start the trading agent:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   The agent will log its activities. You can monitor performance through the logs generated in the `logs` directory.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the trading agent effectively:

### Basic Trading
To perform basic trading, simply configure your trading pairs in the `config.yaml` file and run the agent. It will start trading based on predefined strategies.

### Advanced Strategies
You can implement advanced trading strategies by customizing the model training process. Use the provided synthetic data generation scripts to create datasets tailored to your trading approach.

### Backtesting
Before deploying your agent, consider backtesting your strategies using historical data. This will help you refine your approach and increase the likelihood of success.
